# Hello World! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Victor â€” **Front-End Specialist | React, Redux & Creative Interfaces**  

15+ years building thoughtful interfaces, musical tools, and clean abstractions â€” mostly in my hacker room, not at noisy meetups.  
Mainly frontend (React & Redux), but Iâ€™m comfortable jumping into Ruby on Rails, PHP, WordPress, or whatever gets the job done â€” ramping up fast is part of the fun.

I care about clean structure, elegant abstraction, and minimal boilerplate â€” all in service of creativity, autonomy, and meaningful user experiences.

I value fair pay and clear agreements â€” but more than that, Iâ€™m driven by meaningful work, open collaboration, and sharing knowledge freely. Quality work deserves respect, and Iâ€™m committed to giving my best in return.

**Open to paid roles and creative side projects alike.**  

If youâ€™d rather ship meaningful work than play hiring games â€” reach out.
