Hello World!

my name is Victor ðŸ‘‹ **Frontend Specialist | React, Redux & Creative Interfaces** 

I build thoughtful interfaces and musical tools with ReactJS, Redux, and a touch of sonic experimentation. I value clear structure, elegant abstraction, and minimal boilerplate â€” all in service of creativity, autonomy, and meaningful interaction.

Currently exploring ways to orchestrate music sequences and generative patterns in the browser. Open to ideas that challenge convention but honor simplicity and craft.
